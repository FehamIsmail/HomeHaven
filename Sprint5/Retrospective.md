## What Went Well:
In this last sprint, we have successfully accomplished most of our set objectives even with issues. 
Once again, the team showed great coordination and communation which was present throughout the past sprints.
As usual, our testing coverage remained high even when including our last features for the application.
Deadlines were also met and there was close to no delay. 
Lastly, we have successfully conducted a presentation with the product owners (Teacher and TA) and showed our progress throughout the project.

## What Could Have Gone Better:
Although we achieved many objectives, there are a few we could improve upon. The biggest issue we've had in this sprint was handling the implementation
of all the requirements. This is mainly due to the fact that our team member count changed throughout the sprint. Refactoring responsibilities due to this
took a bit of extra time which delayed certain aspects. Other than that, there were no specific issues on both the document and code side.
