Sprint 3 retrospective

What went well?
Our team coordination and communication this time around was very good. The task separation was done and everyone got something to work on and help each other out when needed. We had channels for separate parts of our project where members could ask for help if they were stuck on something or needed advice. 

What could have gone better?
Our time management could have gone better. At the end, we got everything done by the deadline, however, it was quite a lot of work to do with how short of time we gave ourselves. 

What should change?
We need to start our work way ahead of the deadline of each remaining sprint. This would ensure that there is less stress to be had trying to rush everything last minute, while maintaining a high quality project. Working on everything early would also mean we could peer review each other's work even more than we already do, find problems we wouldnâ€™t normally have and generally refine our project.
